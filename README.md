# muypicky

MuyPicky is a website that lets users sign up and create an account in order to post their favorite menu item at a specific restaurant. Users can sign up, login, and add restaurants and menu items in order for other users to see. It's a great way to showcase your favorite restaurants and menu items. 

This project was tutorial aided. Although I would say that it's more for intermediate-advanced users of Django, it was still a great project. The project tutorial can be found on youtube if you search "try django 1.11" by a user named CodingEntrepeneurs. Through his tutorial, I have learned the basics of how to use Django and its capabilities. 

I've learned how databases work, how URLs work, how different HTTP responses work, and much more! After finishing this projet, I will pursue another simple "To Do" application using Django. This time, I will make it from scratch (with the help of google and stackoverflow) in order to showcase that I've truly understood the basics of the Django framework.
